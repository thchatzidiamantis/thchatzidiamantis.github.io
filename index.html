  <p>
    I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Western Ontario,
    supervised by <a href="https://jdc.math.uwo.ca/">Dan Christensen</a>. I
    like (homotopy) type theory, (higher) category theory, and mathematical
    logic of all kinds.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently trying to figure out what type-theoretic versions of large
    cardinal axioms (large universe axioms?) would look like and understand
    their consequences in univalent category theory and algebra. I also like
    formalising mathematics in proof assistants, currently focused on doing
    constructive mathematics in
    <a href="https://rocq-prover.org/">Coq/Rocq</a> (in particular, the
    Coq-HoTT library), and also having worked with
    <a href="https://rzk-lang.github.io/rzk/en/latest/">Rzk</a> and
    <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I finished my master's at the University of Bonn in August 2024. I wrote
    my <a href="./research/index.html#mscthesis">thesis</a> on simplicial type
    theory, supervised by
    <a href="https://nimarasekh.github.io/">Nima Rasekh</a> and
    <a href="https://florisvandoorn.com">Floris van Doorn</a>. <br />
    Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree from the Aristotle University of
    Thessaloniki.

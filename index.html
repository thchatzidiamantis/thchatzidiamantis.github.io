    <h2>Academic website* of Theofanis Chatzidiamantis-Christoforidis</h2>

    <p>
      I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Western Ontario,
      supervised by <a href="https://jdc.math.uwo.ca/">Dan Christensen</a>. I
      like (homotopy) type theory, (higher) category theory, and mathematical
      logic of all kinds.
    </p>

    <p>
      I finished my master's at the University of Bonn in August 2024. I wrote
      my thesis on simplicial type theory, supervised by
      <a href="https://nimarasekh.github.io/">Nima Rasekh</a> and
      <a href="https://florisvandoorn.com">Floris van Doorn</a>. <br />
      Before all that, I got my Bachelor's degree from the Aristotle University
      of Thessaloniki.

      (*) This is very much work in progress. In particular, none of my code is
      linked here. I should do that.

        [09-12.2025] Together with Thomas Thorbj√∏rnsen, we are organising a
        reading seminar on (\(\infty-\)?)topos theory. I should build the
        website soon.

        [02-04.2025] I supervised an undergraduate student learning about
        <i>model theory</i>, as part of the directed reading program at Western.

      <li>
        [11.2024-05.2025] I am formalising various forms of the
        <i>bar induction</i> axiom and their implications in Coq (in particular,
        the Coq-HoTT library). I'm also thinking about the consequences of
        assuming such axioms from constructive mathematics in homotopy type
        theory.

      <li>
        [07-08.2024] Together with Nima Rasekh, we are wondering what we can
        prove about 2-Segal spaces synthetically, in the setting of simplicial
        type theory.
